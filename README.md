<h1>About</h1>

This script uses protonvpn-cli.
This script was written for practicing coding in Linux shell script.
It doesn't do much other than automating a few commands.

To make it executable, type:
<li>chmod +x vpn-switcher.sh</li>
<li>After that run it in terminal</li>
It can be put into home folder so when opening a new terminal, it can be run immediately by typing.
<li>./vpn-switcher.sh</li>
